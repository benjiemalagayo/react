Step by step by creating this project and packages that I installed

    - npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    - npx tailwindcss init -p
 - 4th I installed GUID(globally unique identifier) - this fix the problem for unique id in mapping array
   - npm install uuid
 - 5th Installed react-bootstrap
   - npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
 - 6th Installed @headlessui/react and @heroicons/react for tailwind navbar
   - npm install @headlessui/react
   - npm install @heroicons/react

   - npm install react-router-dom

React Hooks
 - useState
 - useEffect
 - useParams
 - useNavigate


Using a State Hooks
 - no.1 of state is never assign a value to the variable directly you always go through set whatever tha state is
   - const [test, setTest] = useState() - (use the setTest to assign a value)
